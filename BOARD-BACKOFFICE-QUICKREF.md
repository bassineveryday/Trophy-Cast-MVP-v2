## Before Using the App

**Required: Set up Supabase**

1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Paste the SQL from `SUPABASE-BOARD-SETUP.md`
3. Run it to create `dbm_board_members` table
4. Add your board members' auth.users.id values with their roles

See: `SUPABASE-BOARD-SETUP.md` for complete instructions

## Testing

1. Log in as a test user
2. Get that user's UUID from Supabase auth.users table
3. Add to dbm_board_members table with a role
4. Refresh the app
5. Go to DBM tab → click "Board Tools" button
6. Should see the Board Back Office dashboard

## Next Step: Build First Feature

Pick one:
- **Board Notes** - Easiest (CRUD for docs)
- **Member Mgmt** - Moderate (assign roles)
- **Tournaments** - Most complex
- **Finance** - Budget/reports
- **Conservation** - Project tracking
- **Juniors** - Youth program
- **High School** - HS program
- **Settings** - Preferences

## Architecture

```
Security Layer:
  Supabase → dbm_board_members table (RLS enabled)
       ↓
  useBoardAccess hook (queries RLS policy)
       ↓
  BoardGuard component (checks isBoard)
       ↓
  BoardBackOfficeScreen (only renders if allowed)

Access Flow:
  User UUID → Query dbm_board_members → Get role → Allow/Deny
```
