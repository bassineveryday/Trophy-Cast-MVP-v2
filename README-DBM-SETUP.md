## 🎯 What Was Built

### Database Schema (Ready to Deploy)

**`dbm_board_members` Table**
```
profile_id (UUID)  → Links to auth.users
member_id (TEXT)   → "DBM020", "DBM021", etc.
role (TEXT)        → "DBM President", "DBM Vice President", etc.
created_at         → Timestamp
updated_at         → Timestamp
```

**`is_dbm_board_member()` Function**
- Returns TRUE if user is board member
- Used by RLS policies & client checks

**RLS Policies** (4 total)
- SELECT: Only board members can read
- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: Service role only

### Why DBM Prefix?

✅ **Denver Bassmasters specific** - Clear ownership
✅ **Multi-club ready** - Each club gets their own (`AURORA_`, `CLUB_`, etc.)
✅ **No conflicts** - Tables completely isolated
✅ **Scalable** - Easy to add 10+ clubs

## 🚀 Quick Start (15 min)

### Step 1: Copy the SQL (5 min)
1. Open: `SUPABASE-DBM-BOARD-SETUP.md`
2. Find: "Complete Schema Script (All at Once)"
3. Copy entire SQL block
4. Go to Supabase → SQL Editor → New Query
5. Paste SQL
6. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Add Test Board Member (5 min)
```sql
-- Get your UUID
select id from auth.users where email = 'your@email.com';

-- Add yourself as board member (replace UUID)
insert into public.dbm_board_members (profile_id, member_id, role)
values ('<YOUR_UUID_HERE>', 'DBM020', 'DBM President');
```

### Step 3: Test in Trophy Cast (5 min)
1. Log in as test board member
2. Go to **DBM tab**
3. Should see **gold "Board Tools" button**
4. Click it → See **Board Back Office Dashboard**

✅ **Done!**

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Three Layers

**Layer 1: Client** (UX convenience)
- `useBoardAccess` hook checks
- `BoardGuard` component shows/hides

**Layer 2: Auth** (Identity verification)
- Supabase JWT token
- `auth.users` table

**Layer 3: RLS** (Database enforcement) ✅ **TRUSTED**
- PostgreSQL enforces at query level
- No bypass possible
- Service role required for writes

---

## 📊 What's Ready

### Code ✅
- `hooks/useBoardAccess.ts` - Configured for `dbm_board_members`
- `components/BoardGuard.tsx` - Access control
- `screens/BoardBackOfficeScreen.tsx` - Dashboard
- `App.tsx` - Navigation integrated

### Database ✅
- `dbm_board_members` table (SQL ready)
- `is_dbm_board_member()` function (SQL ready)
- RLS policies (SQL ready)
- Multi-club structure (documented)

### Documentation ✅
- 3 comprehensive setup guides
- Step-by-step instructions
- Troubleshooting
- Reference queries
- Multi-club expansion explained

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Board Member Access
```
✅ Logged in as board member
✅ Go to DBM tab
✅ See gold "Board Tools" button
✅ Click → See Board Back Office
✅ See 8 menu items (Board Notes, Members, etc.)
```

### Test Non-Board Member Access
```
✅ Logged in as non-board member
✅ Go to DBM tab
✅ Don't see "Board Tools" button
✅ Can't access board office
✅ See "Not Authorized" if try to access
```

---

## 👥 Managing Board Members

### Add
```sql
insert into public.dbm_board_members (profile_id, member_id, role)
values ('<UUID>', 'DBM020', 'DBM President');
```

### Remove
```sql
delete from public.dbm_board_members where profile_id = '<UUID>';
```

### Update
```sql
update public.dbm_board_members 
set role = 'DBM Vice President'
where profile_id = '<UUID>';
```

### List All
```sql
select m.*, u.email from public.dbm_board_members m
left join auth.users u on m.profile_id = u.id;
```

## 🔄 Multi-Club Architecture

### Current: DBM Only
```
Trophy Cast
├── DBM Board Tables
│   ├── dbm_board_members
│   ├── dbm_tournaments (future)
│   └── dbm_finance (future)
```

### Future: Multi-Club
```
Trophy Cast
├── DBM Board Tables
│   ├── dbm_board_members
│   ├── dbm_tournaments
│   └── dbm_finance
├── Aurora Board Tables
│   ├── aurora_board_members
│   ├── aurora_tournaments
│   └── aurora_finance
└── Other Clubs...
```

**Each club completely isolated. No conflicts.**
