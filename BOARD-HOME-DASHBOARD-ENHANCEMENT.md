# Board Access Enhancement - Home Dashboard Integration

## Overview
Added Board Tools access card to the home dashboard for board members, making it immediately visible on their home screen without requiring navigation to the DBM members tab.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Dashboard Component (`features/home/EnhancedDashboard.tsx`)

**Imports:**
- Added `useBoardAccess` hook import
- Detects if current user is a DBM board member

**Props:**
- Added optional `navigation` prop to component interface
- Used to navigate to BoardBackOffice when board card is tapped

**Component Logic:**
- Added `const { isBoard } = useBoardAccess();` to detect board membership
- Board card only renders when `isBoard === true`

**New Board Card Section:**
- Positioned after hero catch section (Last Catch)
- Positioned before stats grid (2×2 stats layout)
- Displays only for board members
- Shows:
  - Shield checkmark icon (gold)
  - "Board Tools" title (gold)
  - Description: "Access board administration tools"
  - Call-to-action: "Enter Board Tools"
- On tap: Navigates to BoardBackOffice screen

**Styling:**
- Matches existing card design (Navy background, gold border)
- Uses same typography and spacing as other cards
- Responsive with proper padding and margins
- Active state feedback via Pressable component

### 2. FishingThemedHomeScreen (`screens/FishingThemedHomeScreen.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `navigation` prop to component function signature
- Passed `navigation` prop to `EnhancedDashboard`
- Enables navigation to BoardBackOffice from the board card

boardCard: {
  backgroundColor: COLORS.navyDark,      // #0F2238
  borderWidth: 2,
  borderColor: COLORS.gold,              // #C9A646
  borderRadius: 16,
  padding: 16,
  marginBottom: 24,
}

boardCardName: {
  fontSize: 16,
  fontWeight: '700',
  color: COLORS.gold,
}

boardCardDescription: {
  fontSize: 12,
  color: COLORS.textGray,                // #9AA4B2
}

boardCardAction: {
  fontSize: 12,
  fontWeight: '600',
  color: COLORS.gold,
}
```

## Behavior

### For Board Members

- Card tap navigates to BoardBackOffice screen
- Can access all 8 board administration features
- Seamless integration with existing dashboard

### For Non-Board Members

- Normal dashboard experience unchanged

## Accessibility

- Board Tools card matches existing card styling and spacing
- Uses standard Pressable component for tap targets
- Icon + text for clarity
- Consistent color scheme (Navy + Gold)
- Proper icon sizing for visibility
