4. Paste & Run
5. ✅ Done!

### In 5 More Minutes
```sql
-- Get your UUID
select id from auth.users where email = 'your@email.com';

-- Add yourself as board member (replace UUID)
insert into public.dbm_board_members (profile_id, member_id, role)
values ('<YOUR_UUID>', 'DBM020', 'DBM President');
```

### In 5 More Minutes
1. Log in to Trophy Cast app
2. Go to DBM tab
3. See gold "Board Tools" button
4. Click it → See Board Back Office
5. ✅ Works!

**Total time: 15 minutes**

## 🏗️ What Was Built

### Supabase Schema

**Table**: `dbm_board_members`
```
profile_id (UUID)  → auth.users.id
member_id (TEXT)   → "DBM020", "DBM021", etc.
role (TEXT)        → Board roles
created_at         → Timestamp
```

**Function**: `is_dbm_board_member()`
- Returns TRUE if user is board member
- Used by RLS & client checks

**RLS Policies** (4 policies):
- SELECT: Only board members
- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: Service role only

### Why "DBM" Prefix?

✅ **Clear Ownership** - Denver Bassmasters specific
✅ **Multi-Club Ready** - Each club: `DBM_`, `AURORA_`, `CLUB_`
✅ **No Conflicts** - Completely isolated tables
✅ **Scalable** - Easy to add 10+ clubs

---

## 🔐 How It Works

### Access Flow
```
User logs in
    ↓
useBoardAccess hook checks:
  1. Get auth.users.id
  2. Query dbm_board_members table
  3. RLS policy enforces access
    ↓
Result:
  • If user in table → isBoard = true, show dashboard
  • If user NOT in table → isBoard = false, show "Not Authorized"
```

### Security Layers
```
Layer 1: Client (UX)
  → useBoardAccess hook
  → BoardGuard component

Layer 2: Auth (Identity)
  → Supabase JWT
  → auth.users

Layer 3: RLS (Authorization) ✅ TRUSTED
  → PostgreSQL enforces
  → No bypass possible
```

## 📝 Quick SQL Reference

```sql
-- Find your user UUID
select id from auth.users where email = 'your@email.com';

-- Add board member (replace UUID)
insert into public.dbm_board_members 
  (profile_id, member_id, role)
values 
  ('<YOUR_UUID>', 'DBM020', 'DBM President');

-- Verify
select * from public.dbm_board_members;

-- List all with emails
select m.*, u.email 
from public.dbm_board_members m
left join auth.users u on m.profile_id = u.id;
```

## 🔄 Multi-Club Architecture

### Current (DBM Only)
```
dbm_board_members
dbm_tournaments (future)
dbm_finance (future)
```

### Future (Multi-Club)
```
DBM Tables:
├── dbm_board_members
├── dbm_tournaments
└── dbm_finance

Aurora Tables:
├── aurora_board_members
├── aurora_tournaments
└── aurora_finance

(Each club completely isolated)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Board Tools button doesn't show"
**Fix**: User not in `dbm_board_members` table
```sql
insert into public.dbm_board_members 
  (profile_id, member_id, role)
values ('<UUID>', 'DBM020', 'DBM President');
```

### "Can't find my user UUID"
**Solution**:
```sql
select id, email from auth.users;
```

### "Not working after SQL"
**Check**: 
1. SQL ran without errors?
2. User added to table?
3. App reloaded?
