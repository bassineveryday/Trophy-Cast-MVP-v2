## Trophy Cast App Branding - NOT CHANGED YET

The Trophy Cast app branding (app name, primary branding, TopBar, etc.) remains unchanged as requested. This document focuses only on the Club-specific page.

**Current Trophy Cast Branding**:
- App Name: "Trophy Cast"
- Primary Color: Teal/Blue theme
- Logo: Trophy icon (üèÜ)

**Discussion Points**:
1. Should Trophy Cast app adopt DBM branding colors (gold/navy)?
2. Should the app be renamed to "Denver Bassmasters Trophy Cast" or remain generic?
3. Should the app logo incorporate the DBM bass logo?
4. Should theme colors shift to match DBM's gold/navy palette?

---

## Implementation Steps (For Club Page Only)

1. **Save DBM Logo**
   - Save the provided logo image as `assets/images/dbm-logo.png`

2. **Update ClubScreen.tsx**
   - Import the logo
   - Update club name to "Denver Bassmasters (DBM)"
   - Add logo to hero header
   - Update tagline from 1975 to 1977

   - Verify officer names and contact info match website

3. **Optional Theme Enhancements**
