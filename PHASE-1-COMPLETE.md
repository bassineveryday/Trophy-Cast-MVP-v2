## 🔐 Security Model

### What's Protected ✅

```
Database Layer (RLS Policies)
├── SELECT: Only board members can read
├── INSERT: Service role only
├── UPDATE: Service role only
└── DELETE: Service role only

Auth Layer (Supabase)
├── User authentication
├── JWT tokens
└── Session management

Client Layer (React)
├── useBoardAccess hook
├── BoardGuard component
└── Conditional rendering
```

### Multi-Club Architecture ✅

```
Current: DBM (Denver Bassmasters)
├── dbm_board_members
├── is_dbm_board_member()
└── dbm_* RLS policies

Future: Aurora Club
├── aurora_board_members
├── is_aurora_board_member()
└── aurora_* RLS policies

Future: Any Club
├── clubcode_board_members
├── is_clubcode_board_member()
└── clubcode_* RLS policies

All completely isolated, no conflicts
```

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Test access control with Tai Hunt
2. ✅ Verify non-board member doesn't see button
3. ✅ Test responsive layout

### This Week
1. Pick first feature (recommend: Board Notes)
2. Design feature database schema
3. Build CRUD operations
4. Create React screens
5. Test thoroughly

### This Month
1. Complete 3-4 features
2. Get feedback from board
3. Iterate based on requirements
4. Prepare for full launch

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- ⏳ Menu items are placeholders (click does nothing)
- ⏳ No data persistence (menu items don't connect to database)
- ⏳ No member profile details yet
- ⏳ Other 7 board members not registered

**These are intentional** - waiting for feature development phase.
