## 🔐 SECURITY GUARANTEE

**Three-layer protection**:
1. Client checks (UX convenience)
2. Supabase auth (identity verification)
3. RLS policies (database enforcement) ← **THE SECURE LAYER**

**What's protected**:
- ✅ Only board members see Board Tools button
- ✅ Only board members can access dashboard
- ✅ Non-board users get "Not Authorized"
- ✅ Database RLS enforces access at query level
- ✅ No way to bypass (PostgreSQL enforces it)
