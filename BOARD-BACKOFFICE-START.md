## 🎯 What It Does

### For Regular Members:
- Nothing changes
- They see Trophy Cast normally
- No access to board area

### For Board Members:
- **Gold "Board Tools" button** appears in DBM tab
- Clicking it opens **Board Back Office dashboard**
- See 8 administrative functions:
  - 📄 Board Notes
  - 👥 Member Management
  - 🏆 Tournament Admin
  - 💰 Finance
  - 🌿 Conservation
  - 🎓 Juniors Program
  - 🎓 High School Program
  - ⚙️ Settings

---

## 🔐 Security Built In

✅ **Three-layer security**:
1. Client-side access checks (UX)
2. Supabase auth verification (identity)
3. RLS policies at database level (authorization) ← **TRUSTED**

✅ **Non-board members cannot**:
- See the Board Tools button
- Access board back office
- Query board-only data
- Modify board settings

✅ **Board members can** (once features are built):
- Access all board functions
- Manage club operations
- Track progress
- Make decisions
