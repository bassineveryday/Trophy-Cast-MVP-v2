# 🔍 IMMEDIATE ACTION: Debug Board Button Issue

## The Problem
The Board Tools button isn't visible on your home dashboard or DBM Members tab, even though you're logged in as Tai Hunt (DBM019).

## What Just Got Added
I've created a **diagnostic system** to help debug this:

### 1. 🎯 Diagnostic Screen Component
**File**: `components/BoardAccessDiagnostic.tsx` (New)

A comprehensive UI that shows:
- Your current logged-in UUID
- Current user email
- Board access hook status (isBoard: true/false)
- Your board member data from database
- All board members in the system
- Troubleshooting steps

### 2. 📋 Diagnostic Guide
**File**: `BOARD-ACCESS-DIAGNOSTIC-GUIDE.md` (New)

Step-by-step guide with:
- How to open the diagnostic screen
- What each section means
- 3 different solutions depending on what's wrong
- Manual SQL queries to test
- Quick checklist

### 3. 🛠️ Integration into App
**File**: `App.tsx` (Modified)
- Added diagnostic screen as a navigable route
- You can tap to open it from the app

## Quick Steps Right Now

### Option 1: Use Diagnostic Screen (Easiest)
```
1. Reload your app in Expo
2. Look for a "Board Access Diagnostic" option 
   (might be in settings or you can navigate directly)
3. Follow what the screen tells you
```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Test (Fastest)
Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
-- Check if Tai Hunt is in the database
SELECT * FROM public.dbm_board_members WHERE member_id = 'DBM019';
```

**Expected result**: Should show 1 row with:
- `profile_id`: `8338ec05-7839-45b5-9b3a-115d6d485603`
- `member_id`: `DBM019`
- `role`: `DBM Secretary`

If you see this row → Database is correct ✅

### Option 3: Check Your Current UUID (Most Likely Issue)
Open browser developer tools (F12) and look for console logs:

```
✅ Board access check: { isBoard: false, role: null, userId: "<YOUR-UUID>", data: null }
```

**If you see** `isBoard: false`:
- Your UUID doesn't match what's in the database
- We need to update the database with your real UUID

**To fix it**:

1. Copy your UUID from the console log
2. Go to Supabase → SQL Editor
3. Run:
```sql
-- Update the database with YOUR UUID
DELETE FROM public.dbm_board_members WHERE member_id = 'DBM019';

INSERT INTO public.dbm_board_members (profile_id, member_id, role)
VALUES ('<YOUR-UUID-HERE>', 'DBM019', 'DBM Secretary');

-- Verify
SELECT * FROM public.dbm_board_members WHERE member_id = 'DBM019';
```

4. Reload app
5. Button should now appear!

## Architecture Reminder

The button appears when:

```
✅ User authenticated (logged in)
     ↓
✅ useBoardAccess hook queries database
     ↓
✅ Database has matching UUID in dbm_board_members table
     ↓
✅ RLS policy allows the query
     ↓
✅ Hook returns isBoard = true
     ↓
✅ Component renders button
```

If any step fails → Button won't show

## What Happens Next

### If Board Button Now Shows:
1. ✅ Click "Board Tools" button
2. ✅ Should navigate to Board Back Office
3. ✅ See all 8 board menu items
4. Start building features!

### If Board Button Still Doesn't Show:
1. Open the diagnostic screen
2. Follow the solutions in the guide
3. Most likely: UUID mismatch (Solution A)
4. Update database and reload

## Status

- ✅ Diagnostic component created
- ✅ Diagnostic guide created  
- ✅ App integration done
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub

## Next Phase

Once button is working:
1. ✅ Verify navigation works
2. ✅ Verify home dashboard shows board card
3. ✅ Test with non-board member (should see nothing)
4. 🔨 Build first feature: **Board Notes** (recommended)

---

**Action**: Run the diagnostic or check your UUID in console logs. Most likely it's a UUID mismatch that needs fixing in the Supabase SQL.
