# ⚡ QUICK START - GET APP WORKING NOW

**Status: ✅ All fixes ready to deploy**

## What You Need To Do (3 Steps)

### STEP 1: Deploy Database Migration
**Time: 2 minutes**

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com → Your Project → SQL Editor
2. Create new query
3. Copy entire contents of: `db/migrations/2025-10-18_fix_schema_rls_scoping.sql`
4. Paste into SQL editor
5. Click "RUN"
6. Wait for success message

**Done!** ✅ Your database is now fixed.

---

### STEP 2: Set Environment Variable
**Time: 1 minute**

#### Local Development:
```bash
# File: .env.local
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_AOY_ENABLED=true
```

#### Production (Deployment Platform):
Set these env vars in your deployment:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
EXPO_PUBLIC_AOY_ENABLED=true
```

**Done!** ✅ App can now find your database.

---

### STEP 3: Rebuild & Test
**Time: 5 minutes**

```bash
# Terminal
cd c:\Projects\Trophy-Cast-MVP-v2-1

# Rebuild
npm install
npm run lint
npm test

# If all green ✅, you're done!
# If anything fails, see troubleshooting below
```

---

## VERIFY IT WORKS

After deployment, check:

### In App:
- [ ] AOY screen loads (no errors)
- [ ] See 3 season buttons: 2023, 2024, 2025
- [ ] Click a season → standings update
- [ ] Dashboard shows earnings for current year only

### In Database (Supabase SQL Editor):
```sql
-- Run this query:
SELECT COUNT(*) as aoy_records
FROM public.aoy_standings
WHERE season_year = 2025;

-- Should return: a number > 0 (or NULL if no data)
```

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Error: relation aoy_standings does not exist"
→ **Fix:** Run the migration first (Step 1)

### "AOY screen shows 'Coming Soon'"
→ **Fix:** Check `EXPO_PUBLIC_AOY_ENABLED=true` in .env, then rebuild app

### "Test errors after changes"
→ **Fix:** Run `npm test -- --clearCache`

### "Still broken?"
→ **Full Docs:** Read `DIAGNOSTIC-COMPLETE.md` for detailed analysis
