## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Understand What Was Built (5 min)
Read: `BOARD-BACKOFFICE-QUICKREF.md`

### Step 2: Set Up Supabase (15 min) ⚠️ REQUIRED
Read: `SUPABASE-BOARD-SETUP.md`
Then: Execute the SQL (copy-paste into Supabase SQL Editor)

### Step 3: Test It Works (5 min)
- Log in as a test user
- Add that user to `dbm_board_members` in Supabase
- Go to DBM tab in app
- Should see "Board Tools" button (gold)
- Click it → Should see Board Dashboard

---

## 📱 What Users Will See

### Regular Members:
- App works exactly as before
- No "Board Tools" button
- No access to back office

### Board Members:
- Everything normal, PLUS...
- Gold "Board Tools" button in DBM tab
- Clicking it opens Board Dashboard
- See 8 admin menu items (not functional yet)

---

## 🔐 Security Highlights

✅ **Board access verified at database level (Supabase RLS)**
✅ **Only board members can see board-only data**
✅ **Client-side checks are UX only, not security**
✅ **All future board tables will follow same pattern**
✅ **Ready for audit logging**

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to set up Supabase first?**
A: Yes! Read `SUPABASE-BOARD-SETUP.md` and run the SQL before testing.

**Q: Can non-board members access the back office?**
A: No. The `BoardGuard` component blocks them, and Supabase RLS enforces it.

**Q: Are the 8 menu buttons functional?**
A: Not yet. They're styled UI placeholders. We'll build each feature one at a time.

**Q: How do I add new board members?**
A: Add their auth.users.id UUID to the `dbm_board_members` table in Supabase.

**Q: What's built next?**
A: You decide! Board Notes is recommended first (easiest, highest value).

**Q: Can I customize the menu items?**
A: Yes, edit `screens/BoardBackOfficeScreen.tsx` BOARD_MENU_ITEMS array.

## 🎯 Decision Point

**You have a choice:**

### Option A: Start Simple
✅ Build **Board Notes** first
- Easiest to implement
- Highest value (meeting minutes)
- Good foundation for other features

### Option B: Start Critical
✅ Build **Member Management** first
- Critical for operations
- Assign/manage board roles
- Medium complexity

### Option C: Go Full Feature
✅ Build **Tournament Admin** first
- Most complex
- Core to club mission
- Large feature set

**My recommendation**: Option A (Board Notes) → Option B (Member Mgmt) → Option C (Tournaments)

## ✅ Checklist: Next 24 Hours

- [ ] Read `BOARD-BACKOFFICE-QUICKREF.md`
- [ ] Read `SUPABASE-BOARD-SETUP.md`
- [ ] Create Supabase table (SQL from the doc)
- [ ] Add 1-2 test board members
- [ ] Test app → DBM tab → "Board Tools" button
- [ ] Verify "Not Authorized" for non-board users
- [ ] Decide which feature to build first
- [ ] Let me know! 🚀

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Board Tools button doesn't appear"**
- Are you logged in?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user UUID is in dbm_board_members table

**"Shows 'Not Authorized'"**
- Check your auth.users.id in Supabase
- Make sure it matches dbm_board_members.profile_id
- Profile IDs are UUIDs, not emails

**"Button doesn't work"**
- That's normal! They're placeholders for now
- We'll implement each feature together

---

## 🚀 Ready?

**Next Action**: Read `BOARD-BACKOFFICE-QUICKREF.md` (5 minutes)

Then follow the 3-step Quick Start above.
