# DBM Board Back Office Setup Complete âœ…

## What We Built

A **board-only back office portal** within Trophy Cast for Denver Bassmasters club administrators.

### Components Created:

1. **`hooks/useBoardAccess.ts`** - Hook to check if user is a board member
   - Queries Supabase `dbm_board_members` table
   - Returns: `loading`, `isBoard`, `role`, `error`
   - Handles auth & RLS gracefully

2. **`components/BoardGuard.tsx`** - Access control wrapper
   - Shows loading spinner while checking access
   - Shows "Not Authorized" if user isn't board
   - Wraps board-only screens for security

3. **`screens/BoardBackOfficeScreen.tsx`** - Main dashboard
   - 8 menu cards with icons (Board Notes, Members, Tournaments, Finance, Conservation, Juniors, High School, Settings)
   - Clean Navy + Gold theme matching Trophy Cast
   - Cards are **non-functional placeholders** (buttons don't navigate yet)
   - Protected with `BoardGuard` component

4. **Updated `App.tsx`**
   - Imported `BoardBackOfficeScreen`
   - Added route in Stack Navigator (modal presentation)

5. **Updated `DBMMembersScreen.tsx`**
   - Added "Board Tools" button (only shows for board members)
   - Button navigates to `BoardBackOfficeScreen`

## How It Works

### Security (Supabase RLS)

You need to create this table in Supabase (SQL Editor):

```sql
-- Link board membership to auth.users.id
create table if not exists public.dbm_board_members (
  profile_id uuid primary key references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  member_id text not null,
  role text not null check (char_length(role) > 0),
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

alter table public.dbm_board_members enable row level security;

-- Helper function
create or replace function public.is_dbm_board_member()
returns boolean
language sql
stable
as $$
  select exists (
    select 1
    from public.dbm_board_members m
    where m.profile_id = auth.uid()
  );
$$;
```

### Populate Board Members

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to add board members:

```sql
-- Replace UUIDs with actual auth.users.id of your board members
insert into public.dbm_board_members (profile_id, member_id, role)
values
  ('<UUID_OF_PRESIDENT>', 'DBM020', 'DBM President'),
  ('<UUID_OF_VP>', 'DBM021', 'DBM Vice President'),
  ('<UUID_OF_SECRETARY>', 'DBM019', 'DBM Secretary'),
  ('<UUID_OF_TREASURER>', 'DBM063', 'DBM Treasurer');
```

## Current State

âœ… **Board Back Office Screen is live**
- Only accessible to board members
- Shows 8 menu cards
- Cards are styled but don't navigate anywhere (yet)

ðŸš§ **Next Steps** (waiting for your discussion)

Each button we'll implement one at a time:
1. **Board Notes** - Meeting minutes, agendas, tasks
2. **Member Mgmt** - Manage roster, assign roles
3. **Tournaments** - Create/edit/schedule events
4. **Finance** - Budget, reports, expenses
5. **Conservation** - Project tracking
6. **Juniors Program** - Youth outreach
7. **High School** - HS program admin
8. **Settings** - Board preferences, notifications

---

## Testing

To test, you need:
1. A user account in Supabase auth
2. That user's UUID added to `dbm_board_members` table with a role

Then when you log in:
- Navigate to **DBM** tab â†’ click **Board Tools** (gold button)
- Or navigate directly to the modal route

If not a board member: you'll see "Not Authorized"

## Next: Which Feature First?

Ready to discuss the first board function! Which should we build first?
- ðŸ“‹ Board Notes (easiestâ€”CRUD for meeting docs)
- ðŸ‘¥ Member Mgmt (assign roles, manage permissions)
- ðŸŽ£ Tournaments (most complexâ€”tournament scheduling)
- ðŸ’° Finance (budget tracking, reports)

Let me know! ðŸŽ¯
