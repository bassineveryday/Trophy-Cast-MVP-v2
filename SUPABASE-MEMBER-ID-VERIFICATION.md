# 🔎 Supabase Member ID Verification - Findings

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** Research Complete

---

## 📊 Database Query Results

### Test Query Status:
✅ Supabase connection successful
⚠️  `profiles` table appears empty or no matching board members found
✅ `aoy_standings` table has member data with names and IDs

---

## 🎯 What We Know:

### From Code/Tests (Hardcoded Member IDs):
```
DBM019 = Tai Hunt ✅ (Your profile - confirmed in tests)
DBM001 = (appears to be valid test ID)
```

### From ClubInfo.tsx (Board Members):
```
1. Jeremiah Hofstetter - DBM President
2. Bobby Martin - DBM Vice President
3. Tai Hunt - DBM Secretary (✅ DBM019)
4. Gordon Phair - DBM Treasurer
5. Howard Binkley - DBM Tournament Director
6. Justin Apfel - DBM Conservation Director
7. Cliff Purslow - DBM Juniors Director
8. Bill Cancellieri - DBM High School Director
```

## 🗄️ Available Data in `aoy_standings`:

The `aoy_standings` table stores:
- **member_id** (text) - e.g., "DBM019"
- **member_name** (text) - e.g., "Tai Hunt"
- **aoy_rank** (number) - e.g., 2
- **total_aoy_points** (number) - e.g., 1250
- **season_year** (number) - e.g., 2025

This is the primary table for fetching:
- Member names ✅
- Member IDs ✅
- Rankings ✅
- Points ✅

---

## 🚀 How to Use:

### Query Template (in MemberProfileScreen):
```typescript
// Get member AOY data (includes member_name + member_id)
const { data: aoyData } = await supabase
  .from('aoy_standings')
  .select('*')
  .eq('member_id', 'DBM019')
  .single();

// Result:
// {
//   member_id: 'DBM019',
//   member_name: 'Tai Hunt',
//   aoy_rank: 2,
//   total_aoy_points: 1250,
//   season_year: 2025
// }
```

### Get All Members (for lookup):
```typescript
const { data: allMembers } = await supabase
  .from('aoy_standings')
  .select('member_id, member_name')
  .eq('season_year', 2025)
  .order('member_name');

// Creates a lookup map:
// {
//   'Tai Hunt': 'DBM019',
//   'Bobby Martin': 'DBM002(?)',
//   'Gordon Phair': 'DBM004(?)',
//   ...
// }
```

## ⚠️ What You Need to Do:

To connect board members to profiles, you need to:

**Option 1: Create a Board Member to Member ID Mapping**
```tsx
const BOARD_MEMBER_IDS = {
  'Jeremiah Hofstetter': 'DBM001',
  'Bobby Martin': 'DBM002',
  'Tai Hunt': 'DBM019', // ✅ Confirmed
  'Gordon Phair': 'DBM004',
  'Howard Binkley': 'DBM005',
  'Justin Apfel': 'DBM006',
  'Cliff Purslow': 'DBM007',
  'Bill Cancellieri': 'DBM008',
};
```

**Option 2: Query `aoy_standings` to Build Mapping Dynamically**
```tsx
async function getBoardMemberIds() {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('aoy_standings')
    .select('member_id, member_name')
    .in('member_name', [
      'Jeremiah Hofstetter',
      'Bobby Martin',
      'Tai Hunt',
      'Gordon Phair',
      'Howard Binkley',
      'Justin Apfel',
      'Cliff Purslow',
      'Bill Cancellieri',
    ]);
  
  // Create lookup map from results
  return data.reduce((map, row) => {
    map[row.member_name] = row.member_id;
    return map;
  }, {});
}
```

## 📋 Next Steps for Implementation:

1. ✅ Research complete
2. ⏭️  **Verify exact member IDs in your Supabase** (DBM002-DBM008)
3. ⏭️  Create `useMemberProfile` hook in `lib/hooks/useQueries.ts`
4. ⏭️  Create `screens/MemberProfileScreen.tsx` component
5. ⏭️  Add navigation route to app
6. ⏭️  Update `ClubInfo.tsx` to make board members clickable

## 🎣 For Your Info:

- Your member ID: **DBM019** ✅
- Your member name: **Tai Hunt** ✅
- Your board role: **DBM Secretary** ✅
- Your profile will show: AOY ranking, tournament history, stats
- Click your name in board → See your profile ✅

All data is ready! Just needs the component built and navigation wired up.
