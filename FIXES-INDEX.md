## 🔥 WHAT WAS BROKEN

1. **AOY data had NO SCOPING** → All seasons mixed
2. **No feature flag** → App crashes if DB missing
3. **Hardcoded 2025** → Won't work after 2025
4. **Bad date handling** → Silent data loss
5. **Column naming mismatch** → Queries failed
6. **RLS policies useless** → `USING (true)` (no filtering)
7. **No season selector UI** → Can't view past seasons

---

## 🛠️ WHAT WAS FIXED

✅ AOY properly scoped by season  
✅ Feature flag for safe enable/disable  
✅ Dynamic year calculation (2026+ ready)  
✅ Consistent date extraction  
✅ Proper column names (cash_payout)  
✅ Real RLS policies with filtering  
✅ Interactive season selector UI
