## ✅ VERIFICATION STEPS

### After running migration:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run these to verify:

-- 1. Check new columns exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name='tournament_results'
AND column_name IN ('is_demo', 'cash_payout', 'season_year')
ORDER BY column_name;

-- 2. Check AOY view works
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.aoy_standings LIMIT 1;

-- 3. Check RLS policies (not USING true)
SELECT policyname, qual FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename='aoy_standings';
```

### After deploying code:
```bash
npm test -- --runInBand      # Should pass ✅
npm run lint                  # Should pass ✅
npx tsc --noEmit             # Should pass ✅
npm start                    # Launch app
```

### In the app:
- AOY screen loads ✅
- Season buttons appear ✅
- Clicking season updates standings ✅
- Dashboard shows current year ✅

→ Rebuild app: `npm start` (hot reload won't work)

**Still broken?**
→ See troubleshooting in DEPLOYMENT.md
