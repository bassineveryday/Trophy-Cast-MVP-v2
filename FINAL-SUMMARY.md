## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### Critical Issues (App-Breaking)
1. ✅ **AOY fetched with NO SCOPE** → Added season_year/club_id parameters
2. ✅ **useAOYStandings() hook had NO parameters** → Made hook parameterized
3. ✅ **NO AOY_ENABLED feature flag** → Added env var + feature flag check
4. ✅ **RLS policies used USING (true)** → Replaced with real row filtering

### High Severity (Data Corruption)
5. ✅ **AOY view used ambiguous fallback** → Removed COALESCE logic
6. ✅ **Inconsistent date handling** → Standardized to EXTRACT(YEAR)
7. ✅ **Duplicate migrations** → Created consolidated migration
8. ✅ **Missing cash_payout column** → Renamed payout → cash_payout
9. ✅ **Hardcoded 2025 date** → Made dynamic year calculation

### Medium Severity (Architecture Gaps)
10. ✅ **No is_demo column** → Added for lane separation
11. ✅ **Dead code (fetchAOYStandingsByMember)** → Documented & kept for compat
12. ✅ **No season selector UI** → Added interactive season selector
