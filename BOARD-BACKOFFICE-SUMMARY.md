## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BoardBackOfficeScreen (UI Layer)       │
│  - 8 menu cards with icons & colors     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BoardGuard (Access Control Layer)      │
│  - Checks if user allowed               │
│  - Shows loading/denied states          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  useBoardAccess Hook (Auth Layer)       │
│  - Queries Supabase for board status    │
│  - Returns: loading, isBoard, role      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Supabase Auth + RLS (Security Layer)   │
│  - dbm_board_members table              │
│  - RLS policies protect data            │
│  - Auth.users.id is the key             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Security Model:
- ✅ Secure RLS policies at database level
- ✅ Client-side checks for UX (not security)
- ✅ No board member list exposed to non-board
- ✅ Only service role can modify board membership

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### What's Protected:
1. **Board Access Check**: Supabase RLS query
2. **Access Gating**: BoardGuard component
3. **Data Isolation**: RLS policies at database level
4. **Audit Ready**: Structure for logging all board actions

### Trust Model:
- ❌ Don't trust client-side `isBoard` flag for security decisions
- ✅ Always verify server-side on backend API calls
- ✅ All board tables will have `is_dbm_board_member()` in RLS policies
- ✅ User's auth.users.id is the source of truth

---
