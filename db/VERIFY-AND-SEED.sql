-- Step 1: Check if Tai Hunt (DBM019) exists in tournament_members
SELECT 'Checking tournament_members for DBM019...' as status;
SELECT * FROM tournament_members WHERE member_id = 'DBM019';

-- If not found, insert Tai Hunt:

VALUES ('DBM019', 'Tai Hunt', 'B', 'DBM', 'Denver Bassmasters')

-- Step 2: Check for existing tournament events
SELECT 'Checking tournament_events...' as status;
SELECT event_id, tournament_name, event_date, lake FROM tournament_events 
WHERE event_date >= '2024-01-01' 
ORDER BY event_date DESC

-- Step 3: Check for tournament results for DBM019
SELECT 'Checking tournament_results for DBM019...' as status;
SELECT * FROM tournament_results 
WHERE member_id = 'DBM019' 
ORDER BY event_date DESC;

-- If no results exist, add test data:

-- Step 4: Check AOY standings

-- If no AOY standing exists, add one:

-- Note: Profiles are created when users register, so we can't pre-create them
-- The user will need to register with email/password and link to DBM019
