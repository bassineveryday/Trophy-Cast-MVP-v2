## ✅ After Running SQL

### Verify Data (run these queries separately):

```sql
-- Check your member record
SELECT * FROM tournament_members WHERE member_id = 'DBM019';

-- Check your profile link
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = 'dca2ffc1-a1c5-4e80-aba5-dd646bede2fb';

-- Check your tournament results
SELECT 
  tournament_name, 
  event_date, 
  place, 
  weight_lbs, 
  payout 
FROM tournament_results 
WHERE member_id = 'DBM019' 
ORDER BY event_date DESC;

-- Check your AOY standing
SELECT * FROM aoy_standings WHERE member_id = 'DBM019';

-- Calculate your total earnings
SELECT 
  member_id,
  COUNT(*) as tournaments,
  SUM(payout) as total_earnings,
  AVG(place) as avg_finish
FROM tournament_results 
WHERE member_id = 'DBM019' 
  AND event_date >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY member_id;
```

**Expected Result:** Total Earnings = $1,000 from 3 tournaments
