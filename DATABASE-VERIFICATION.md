# üîç Database Connection Verification

This script will verify that your Supabase database is properly connected and contains the expected data structure for Trophy Cast.

## Quick Database Status Check

**Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor** to verify the current state:

```sql
-- ============================================
-- TROPHY CAST DATABASE VERIFICATION
-- ============================================

-- Check if core tables exist and have data
SELECT 'tournament_events' as table_name, count(*) as record_count 
FROM tournament_events
UNION ALL
SELECT 'aoy_standings' as table_name, count(*) as record_count 
FROM aoy_standings
UNION ALL
SELECT 'tournament_members' as table_name, count(*) as record_count 
FROM tournament_members
UNION ALL
SELECT 'profiles' as table_name, count(*) as record_count 
FROM profiles
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check for Tai Hunt's data specifically
SELECT 
  'Tai Hunt Member Record' as check_type,
  CASE WHEN EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM tournament_members WHERE member_id = 'DBM019') 
    THEN '‚úÖ Found' ELSE '‚ùå Missing' END as status
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Tai Hunt AOY Standing' as check_type,
  CASE WHEN EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM aoy_standings WHERE member_id = 'DBM019') 
    THEN '‚úÖ Found' ELSE '‚ùå Missing' END as status
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Tournament Events' as check_type,
  CASE WHEN EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM tournament_events WHERE event_date >= '2024-01-01') 
    THEN '‚úÖ Found Recent Events' ELSE '‚ùå No Recent Events' END as status;

-- Show sample data if it exists
SELECT 'SAMPLE AOY DATA:' as info;
SELECT member_id, member_name, aoy_rank, total_aoy_points 
FROM aoy_standings 
ORDER BY aoy_rank 
LIMIT 3;

SELECT 'SAMPLE TOURNAMENT DATA:' as info;
SELECT event_id, tournament_name, event_date, lake 
FROM tournament_events 
ORDER BY event_date DESC 
LIMIT 3;
```

## Expected Results

If your database is **ready**, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Multiple records in each table
- ‚úÖ Tai Hunt (DBM019) in member and AOY records  
- ‚úÖ Recent tournament events
- ‚úÖ Sample data displaying correctly

If your database is **empty** or **missing tables**, you'll see:
- ‚ùå Error messages about missing tables
- ‚ùå Zero record counts
- ‚ùå Missing status indicators

## Next Steps Based on Results

### ‚úÖ If Database Has Data
**Status**: Ready to connect app to real data!
**Action**: Test the app immediately - it should work with real data

### ‚ùå If Database is Empty or Missing Tables  
**Status**: Need to set up database schema and test data
**Action**: Run the complete database setup process

### ‚ö†Ô∏è If Database Has Partial Data
**Status**: Database exists but may be missing key records
**Action**: Add missing test data or verify schema matches app expectations

## Testing the App Connection

After verifying database status, test the app:

```bash
# Start the app
npm start

# Choose web platform (w) for easiest testing
# Try to login or view tournament data
```

**Expected Behavior with Real Data**:
- Home screen shows actual AOY rankings and tournament data
- Tournaments screen lists real events with dates and locations
- AOY screen shows member leaderboard with accurate points
- Authentication works with real member codes

**Expected Behavior with Empty Database**:
- Loading spinners that never complete
- Empty states or error messages
- Authentication may fail or show no profile data

**Run the SQL verification above and let me know the results!** üéØ

We'll then proceed with either:
1. **Testing real data connection** (if database ready)
2. **Database setup process** (if database empty)
3. **Troubleshooting specific issues** (if partial data)
