## 📋 Setup Checklist

### For You (User):
```
BEFORE TESTING:
✅ Read: BOARD-BACKOFFICE-README.md (starting point)
✅ Read: SUPABASE-BOARD-SETUP.md (required setup)
✅ Create Supabase table (copy-paste SQL)
✅ Add test board member (replace UUID)
✅ Test access control

READY TO BUILD:
✅ Pick first feature (recommend: Board Notes)
✅ Let me know which feature
✅ We build it together
```

### For This Codebase:
```
VALIDATION:
✅ TypeScript compilation: PASS
✅ No TypeScript errors: PASS
✅ All imports resolved: PASS
✅ Code style: PASS

READY FOR:
✅ Testing on device

## 🔐 Security Guarantee

**Three-Layer Security Model**:

```
1. Client Layer (UX)
   └─ useBoardAccess hook
      └─ BoardGuard component

2. Auth Layer (Identity)
   └─ Supabase JWT tokens
      └─ auth.users verification

3. Database Layer (Authorization) ← TRUSTED
   └─ RLS policies
      └─ is_dbm_board_member() function
         └─ dbm_board_members table
```

**What's Protected**:
- ✅ Only board members can access board back office
- ✅ Non-board members see "Not Authorized"
- ✅ RLS prevents database access at query level
- ✅ Service role required for board membership changes
- ✅ All actions can be logged/audited

**Security Best Practice**:
> Trust the database layer (RLS), not the client. Client checks are for UX only.
