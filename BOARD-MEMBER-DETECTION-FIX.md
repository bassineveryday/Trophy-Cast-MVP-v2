# üîç BOARD MEMBER DETECTION - DIAGNOSTIC STEPS

## Current Status
‚úÖ App boots successfully  
‚úÖ Navigation hook wired correctly  
‚ùå **Board member detection returning `data: null`** - record not found

## Root Cause Analysis

The console shows:
```
Query result: {data: null, error: null}
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ RLS policy is working (no error thrown)
- ‚ùå BUT no matching record found in database

## Quick Fix: Verify and Insert Record

### STEP 1: Check If Record Exists in Supabase

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Run this query:

```sql
-- Check for Tai Hunt record
SELECT profile_id, member_id, role 
FROM public.dbm_board_members 
WHERE member_id = 'DBM019';
```

**Expected Result:**
```
profile_id                          member_id  role
8338ec05-7839-45b5-9b3a-115d6d485603  DBM019   DBM Secretary
```

### STEP 2A: If Record EXISTS ‚Üí Success!

If you see the Tai Hunt record, the issue might be with the RLS policy still.  
Try running:

```sql
-- Test SELECT with our credentials
SELECT * FROM public.dbm_board_members 
WHERE profile_id = '8338ec05-7839-45b5-9b3a-115d6d485603'::uuid;
```

---

### STEP 2B: If Record DOESN'T EXIST ‚Üí Insert It

If you see no results, run this to add Tai Hunt:

```sql
-- Insert Tai Hunt as a board member
INSERT INTO public.dbm_board_members (profile_id, member_id, role, created_at)
VALUES 
  ('8338ec05-7839-45b5-9b3a-115d6d485603'::uuid, 'DBM019', 'DBM Secretary', now())
ON CONFLICT (profile_id) DO NOTHING;

-- Verify it was inserted
SELECT * FROM public.dbm_board_members WHERE member_id = 'DBM019';
```

---

### STEP 3: Verify RLS Policy

Run this to see the current SELECT policy:

```sql
-- Check RLS policies
SELECT policyname, qual, roles 
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'dbm_board_members' 
  AND policyname LIKE '%select%';
```

Should show: `using (true)` or `using (public.is_dbm_board_member())`

---

## After Fix: Test in App

1. **Keep dev server running** (if not already)
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Refresh browser** at http://localhost:8082

3. **Check console logs** for:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Board access check COMPLETE: {isBoard: true, role: 'DBM Secretary', ...}
   ```

4. **Verify on screen**: Green checkmark should appear next to "Board Tools (TEST)"

---

## If Still Not Working

If you see `isBoard: false` even after inserting the record, check:

1. **Dev mode UUID** - Is `lib/AuthContext.tsx` line 52 still set to real UUID?
   ```
   id: '8338ec05-7839-45b5-9b3a-115d6d485603'
   ```

2. **RLS Policy** - Is it set to `using (true)` for SELECT?

3. **Table Structure** - Does the record exist?

## Diagnostic File

I've created `db/VERIFY-BOARD-MEMBERS.sql` with all verification queries.  
Just copy any query from there and run in Supabase SQL Editor.
