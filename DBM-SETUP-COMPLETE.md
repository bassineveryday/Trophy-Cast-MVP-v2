# ✅ DBM Board Setup - Complete

## 🎉 Supabase Setup Ready!

I've created everything you need for a **DBM-specific board management system** in Supabase. The setup is designed for **multi-club expansion** - each club gets their own tables with a clear prefix.

---

## 📦 What Was Created

### Documentation Files ✅

1. **`SUPABASE-DBM-BOARD-SETUP.md`** - Complete SQL setup guide
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - All SQL code ready to copy/paste
   - Verification queries
   - Troubleshooting

2. **`DBM-BOARD-SETUP-GUIDE.md`** - Implementation guide
   - Quick start (15 min)
   - Test instructions
   - Managing board members
   - Multi-club expansion explained

### Code Already Ready ✅

The `useBoardAccess.ts` hook is **already configured** to use:
- Table: `dbm_board_members`
- Function: `is_dbm_board_member()`
- Queries: DBM-specific board access

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor (2 min)
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Click **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Run the Complete Schema (5 min)
1. Open: `SUPABASE-DBM-BOARD-SETUP.md`
2. Find: "Complete Schema Script (All at Once)"
3. Copy the entire SQL block
4. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click **Run**

✅ Creates:
- `dbm_board_members` table
- `is_dbm_board_member()` function
- 4 RLS policies

### Step 3: Add a Test Board Member (5 min)

**Get your UUID**:
```sql
select id from auth.users where email = 'your@email.com';
```

**Add yourself as board member** (replace UUID):
```sql
insert into public.dbm_board_members (profile_id, member_id, role)
values ('<YOUR_UUID_HERE>', 'DBM020', 'DBM President');
```

**Verify it worked**:
```sql
select * from public.dbm_board_members;
```

### Step 4: Test in Trophy Cast App (3 min)

1. Log in as the board member user
2. Go to **DBM tab**
3. Should see **gold "Board Tools" button**
4. Click it → See **Board Back Office Dashboard**

✅ **Success!**

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Table Structure
```
DBM Schema:
├── public.dbm_board_members
│   ├── profile_id (UUID) → Links to auth.users.id
│   ├── member_id (TEXT) → "DBM020", "DBM021", etc.
│   ├── role (TEXT) → "DBM President", "DBM Secretary", etc.
│   └── created_at, updated_at
│
├── public.is_dbm_board_member() (Function)
│   └── Returns TRUE if user is board member
│
└── RLS Policies
    ├── SELECT: Only board members can read
    ├── INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: Service role only
```

### Multi-Club Ready
```
DBM Schema:
├── dbm_board_members
├── dbm_tournaments (future)
├── dbm_finance (future)
└── ...

Aurora Schema:
├── aurora_board_members
├── aurora_tournaments (future)
├── aurora_finance (future)
└── ...

Club A Schema:
├── cluba_board_members
├── cluba_tournaments (future)
└── ...
```

Each club completely isolated. No conflicts. Easy to scale.

## 🔐 Security Explained

### Three-Layer Protection

**Layer 1: Client-Side (UX)**
- `useBoardAccess` hook checks membership
- `BoardGuard` component shows/hides content
- Purpose: User experience

**Layer 2: Authentication (Supabase Auth)**
- User must be logged in
- JWT token verifies identity
- Purpose: Who are you?

**Layer 3: RLS Policies (Database) ✅ TRUSTED**
- PostgreSQL enforces at query level
- Only board members can query table
- Non-board gets zero rows (not error)
- Service role required for modifications
- Purpose: What can you access?

**Trust Model**: Layer 3 (RLS) is the security boundary. Layers 1-2 are for UX.

---

## 📋 Board Member Roles

```
DBM020 → DBM President
DBM021 → DBM Vice President
DBM019 → DBM Secretary
DBM063 → DBM Treasurer
DBM004 → DBM Tournament Director
DBM045 → DBM Conservation Director
DBM002 → DBM Juniors Director
DBM014 → DBM High School Director
```

## 🧪 Testing Access

### Test 1: Board Member ✅

**Steps**:
1. Log in as a user in `dbm_board_members` table
2. Go to DBM tab
3. **See**: Gold "Board Tools" button
4. Click it
5. **See**: Board Back Office Dashboard (8 menu items)

### Test 2: Non-Board Member ✅

**Steps**:
1. Log in as a user NOT in `dbm_board_members` table
2. Go to DBM tab
3. **Don't see**: "Board Tools" button
4. Try to navigate to board office (if possible)
5. **See**: "Not Authorized" message

### Test 3: Anonymous User ✅

**Steps**:
1. Log out
2. Try to access board back office
3. **See**: Auth required error

## 👥 Managing Board Members

### Find a User
```sql
select id, email from auth.users 
where email = 'president@denver-bassmasters.com';
```

### Add Board Member
```sql
insert into public.dbm_board_members (profile_id, member_id, role)
values ('<UUID>', 'DBM020', 'DBM President');
```

### Update Role
```sql
update public.dbm_board_members 
set role = 'DBM Vice President'
where profile_id = '<UUID>';
```

### Remove Board Member
```sql
delete from public.dbm_board_members 
where profile_id = '<UUID>';
```

### List All Board Members
```sql
select m.profile_id, m.member_id, m.role, u.email, m.created_at
from public.dbm_board_members m
left join auth.users u on m.profile_id = u.id
order by m.created_at;
```

## 📊 Schema Details

### `dbm_board_members` Table

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| profile_id | UUID | Primary key, links to auth.users.id |
| member_id | TEXT | DBM member ID (DBM020, DBM021, etc.) |
| role | TEXT | Board role (DBM President, etc.) |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | Timestamp when added |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | Timestamp when modified |

**Indexes**:
- `idx_dbm_board_members_profile_id` - Fast lookups by user
- `idx_dbm_board_members_member_id` - Fast lookups by member ID

**RLS Status**: Enabled ✅

### `is_dbm_board_member()` Function

**Returns**: BOOLEAN
- TRUE if current user is in `dbm_board_members`
- FALSE if not a board member
- FALSE if not authenticated

**Usage**: 
- RLS policies use it
- Client checks use it (via hook)

### RLS Policies

| Policy | Operation | Condition |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| dbm_board_members_select | SELECT | User is board member |
| dbm_board_members_insert_deny | INSERT | Never (service role only) |
| dbm_board_members_update_deny | UPDATE | Never (service role only) |
| dbm_board_members_delete_deny | DELETE | Never (service role only) |

## ✅ Checklist

Before testing, verify:

- [ ] Ran complete schema SQL in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Added at least one test board member
- [ ] Verified query returned results:
  ```sql
  select * from public.dbm_board_members;
  ```
- [ ] App is running (`npm start`)
- [ ] Logged in as test board member user
- [ ] Can see "Board Tools" button in DBM tab

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Board Tools button doesn't show"
**Check**: Is user in `dbm_board_members` table?
```sql
select * from dbm_board_members 
where profile_id = 'YOUR_UUID';
```

### "Getting 'Not Authorized' in app"
**Fix**: User is not a board member. Add them to `dbm_board_members` table.

### "Can't find my user UUID"
**Solution**:
```sql
select id, email from auth.users;
```
Find your email, copy the UUID.

### "RLS policies not working"
**Check**: Are policies created?
```sql
select * from pg_policies where tablename = 'dbm_board_members';
```
Should show 4 policies.

## 🔄 Future: Multi-Club Setup

When Aurora Bass Club joins:

```sql
-- Create Aurora tables (same pattern, different prefix)
create table public.aurora_board_members (
  profile_id uuid primary key references auth.users(id),
  member_id text not null,
  role text not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- Aurora helper function
create or replace function public.is_aurora_board_member()
returns boolean language sql stable as $$
  select exists (
    select 1 from public.aurora_board_members 
    where profile_id = auth.uid()
  );
$$;

-- Aurora RLS policies (same pattern)
create policy "aurora_select" on aurora_board_members
  for select to authenticated
  using (is_aurora_board_member());
```

**Result**:
- DBM: `dbm_*` tables
- Aurora: `aurora_*` tables
- Each club isolated
- No data conflicts
- Easy to scale to 10+ clubs
