## 🛠️ Implementation Files Needed

### **NEW FILES (Need to create):**
1. `screens/MemberProfileScreen.tsx`
   - Main member profile component
   - Shows member info + tournament history
   - ~300-400 lines of code

### **FILES TO MODIFY:**
1. `lib/hooks/useQueries.ts`
   - Add `useMemberProfile(memberId)` hook
   - ~30-40 lines of code

2. `features/club/ClubInfo.tsx`
   - Add press handlers to board members
   - Pass member_id to navigation
   - ~20-30 lines of code

3. Navigation config (app.json or RootNavigator)
   - Add `MemberProfile` route
   - ~10 lines of code

---

## 📡 Data Flow

```
BOARD MEMBER TAP
    ↓
CLUBINFO.TSX gets press
    ↓
navigation.navigate('MemberProfile', { member_id: 'DBM019' })
    ↓
MEMBERPROFILESCREEN loads
    ↓
useMemberProfile('DBM019') hook fires
    ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Query 1: aoy_standings             │
│ WHERE member_id = 'DBM019'         │
│ Returns: name, rank, points        │
├────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Query 2: tournament_results        │
│ WHERE member_id = 'DBM019'         │
│ Returns: tournament history        │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
DISPLAY: Member profile + stats + tournaments
```

## ✨ Design Highlights

✅ **Consistent Navy + Gold theme** - Matches existing app  
✅ **Reuses existing patterns** - No new concepts  
✅ **React Query for caching** - Efficient data fetching  
✅ **Scrollable tournament list** - Handle many results  
✅ **Loading/error states** - Professional UX  
✅ **Responsive grid layout** - Works on all screens

## 🎯 Board Members List

These 8 board members will be clickable:

| Name | Current Role |
|------|--------------|
| Jeremiah Hofstetter | DBM President |
| Bobby Martin | DBM Vice President |
| **Tai Hunt** | **DBM Secretary** ✅ |
| Gordon Phair | DBM Treasurer |
| Howard Binkley | DBM Tournament Director |
| Justin Apfel | DBM Conservation Director |
| Cliff Purslow | DBM Juniors Director |
| Bill Cancellieri | DBM High School Director |

## 📝 Key Design Decisions

1. **Use `aoy_standings` as primary data source**
   - Has member names + IDs already
   - Provides rank & points
   - No extra joins needed

2. **Fetch `tournament_results` for history**
   - All tournament data in one table
   - Easy to filter by member_id
   - Has earnings data

3. **Make board members clickable from Club tab**
   - Keep board info visible in Club section
   - Tap member name → See full profile
   - Simple navigation pattern

4. **Store board role in BOARD_MEMBERS array**
   - No need to add to database
   - Already has role data in ClubInfo
   - Just match name to get role

## ✅ Everything Is Ready

### No Blockers:
- ✅ All database tables exist
- ✅ All data is available
- ✅ Supabase client configured

- ✅ Data structure documented
- ✅ UI mockups created
- ✅ Component outline ready
- ✅ Navigation plan defined

---

## 🚀 Next Phase

When you're ready to implement, you have two options:

**OPTION 1: Ask me to build it**
- I'll create MemberProfileScreen.tsx
- I'll update ClubInfo.tsx for clicks
- I'll add the navigation route
- I'll create the useMemberProfile hook

**OPTION 2: Build it yourself**
- Use the design documents as guides
- Reference code patterns in existing components
- Use the data flow diagrams to build hooks
- Leverage existing theme colors

Both approaches should take 30-60 minutes.
